# Eventually

## Eventually Overview
- Eventually is an Eventbrite.com clone. Eventually allows users to create sales, view other users' posted sales, and if they are interested, they can push a button to let the host know they will be attending.

## How it's made
- Eventually uses React for the user interface, and PostgreSQL and Express for the back end.

## How to use Eventually
- First, create an account by clicking the 'Sign up' button in the navigation bar at the top of the page. Or, alternatively you can click "Log in" and use a demo user to test out the features.

- Next, you will be taken to your "Home Page" where a list of sales is shown. From this page, you can create an event or check out a sale for more information. 

- When you click on a sale, you will be taken to the sale page. This page shows more information on the sale, such as how many people plan on attending. From this page, you can click a button that will add or remove the user from the guest list.

- In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, you will see a button to create a new sale. If the user has already logged in, they will be taken to the "create sale" page. If they are not logged in, they will be redirected to the log in page.

- To create a sale, you must provide a title for the sale, select the neighborhood which it will be hosted in, and what type of sale it is (e.g. yard sale, garage sale). The last input option is for a display image. You must find the URL of the image you want to display, then insert it into the last input line.

- Once you have created a sale, some new buttons will appear on the sale information page. These buttons will allow you to edit or delete your sale.

- At the bottom of every page, there is a footer with links to my personal accounts. Feel free to check out some of my other work!
